# Prework - *Aries and I*

Submitted by: **Natalie Gallo**

**Aries and I** is an app where I introduce myself and my dog, Aries. [TODO] 

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite apps and features I like:

Discord
- The ability to add bots to servers
- customizing profile (with Nitro)
- Choosing your own online status

Tumblr
- Ability to customize the theme of the entire app
- The various types of fonts and images that are allowed to be embeded in a post

Pinterest
- Great recommendation algorithm
- User Privacy
- nice organization features for pins/boards

An app I would like to build is an app similar to mySugr and other health tracker apps.
I want to make an app that helps users (target audience of those with diabetes)
track their blood sugar and monitor the pattern of their sugar. It would be like a journal 
style app. Maybe even include notifications to remind the user to monitor themselves, 
especially if patterns suggest that their blood tends to go too high/low at a certain time
interval. 

## Notes

Getting Xcode up and running was a bit of a hassle. It would slow my progress,
but it all worked out. A future goal is learning how to implement more "complex" features.
